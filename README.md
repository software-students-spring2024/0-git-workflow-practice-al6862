# IDN - esoteric.codes

[(link to article)](https://esoteric.codes/blog/jodis-idn)

I found this article about domain names on esoteric.codes, a blog/encyclopedia/archive about esoteric programming languages. By using Punycode, "an ASCII transcoding meant to represent Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)," art duo JODI were able to name their websites ᠐.com and ꀍ.com even after single-letter domains were banned in 1993. Note that the ᠐ in ᠐.com is not the same character as the Roman character for 0 and is actually the "Mongolian Numerical Zero." Because a domain is only registered with the ASCII encoding, what really is registered when registering ᠐.com is xn--m6e.com. I thought it was a clever way to circumvent web standards, and I want to learn more about the process and art practice of JODI while they built these websites.
